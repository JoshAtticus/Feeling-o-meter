# Josh's Cool Feeling Website (_uwu_)
If you really want to know what this is, it's essentially a website I am making for school to help my teachers better understand me. I also update _feeling.html_ to show how I am feeling, and a description of it.

# Ok but how do I see it?
By clicking [this link](https://www.joshatticus.eu.org/joshscoolfeelingwebsiteuwu) that only people who are scared of links won't touch.

# Why did you post your email there?
**I didn't**. My protected email is essentially an ID shield, where instead of posting my school email address, I post my Firefox Relay address, and that way, when I recieve an email, I can see who it is and choose if I want to reply. My school email is a Office 365 exchange email address, so good luck trying to send an email without a big "This email isn't from a *school name here* student or staff member" banner I see whenever I recieve an email.
